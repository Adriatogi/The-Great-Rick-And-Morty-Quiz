Project 3?—?Small JavaScript Quiz Game
Objective: Create a JavaScript/jQuery quiz game that takes multiple answers and shows a result to the user.
Once you start learning JavaScript, it can be really difficult to know how to apply your knowledge and decide on a project within the scope of your ability. 
Creating a small quiz game is a really great place to start. It drills in DOM manipulation, as well as being a creative way to show your personality. 
You’ll have to deal with surprisingly complex logic, and the scope of quiz complexity is really yours to reign in and/or expand upon.

JavaScript Quiz Game to find you the grilled cheese of your dreams.
Start with creating a simple game that asks 4 multiple choice questions. Using those questions, assign them a value which will point to an outcome. 
You’ll learn a lot about data management and creating a scoring system in programming. Don’t spend too much time focusing on the design of what you’re creating. 
I would even suggest getting familiar with a CSS framework that takes care of the styling for you during this project. 
Remember, if your goal is to become a better web developer, leave the designing for the professionals.
