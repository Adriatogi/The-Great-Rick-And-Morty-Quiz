# The-Great-Rick-And-Morty-Quiz
To run my project/website. https://adriatogi.github.io/The-Great-Rick-And-Morty-Quiz/

The idea came from a post about projects to make to practive front end development as stated below

Project 3—Small JavaScript Quiz Game <br />
Objective: Create a JavaScript/jQuery quiz game that takes multiple answers and shows a result to the user.
Once you start learning JavaScript, it can be really difficult to know how to apply your knowledge and decide on a project within the scope of your ability. <br />
Creating a small quiz game is a really great place to start. It drills in DOM manipulation, as well as being a creative way to show your personality. <br />
You’ll have to deal with surprisingly complex logic, and the scope of quiz complexity is really yours to reign in and/or expand upon.
